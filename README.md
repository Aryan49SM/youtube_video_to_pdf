# YouTube to PDF Converter üé•‚û°Ô∏èüìÑ

Hey there, are you also a fan of StatQuest? I follow the machine learning and statistics playlist from StatQuest, but I'm a bit lazy to make notes. So, I built this tool to help you generate PDFs from your favorite YouTube videos!

This repository provides a simple way to extract key frames from YouTube videos and compile them into a downloadable PDF. Built with Python and Streamlit, it's perfect for quickly generating study notes or slide decks from online video content.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aryan49SM/youtube_video_to_pdf.git
   cd youtube_video_to_pdf
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
  
  ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows:
    source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux:
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
